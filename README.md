# FreeGPS

In one network meaurement project, I had to collect network data from different locations. I developed this app to change my Android phone GPS and collect data.

It gets a list of GPS coordinates as a txt file and an Integer number n as time intervals, then it changes the phone's GPS to the next location in every n seconds.
